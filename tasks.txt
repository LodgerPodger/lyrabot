1. Rolls
2. More Uno

UNO STUFF
  The actual "UNO!" part of uno
  Timers -- turn reminders, autokicks, etc. (Use client.loop.call_later ?)
  More obvious layout for cards you can/can't play (bold? organization?)
  Emoji reacts to play (like, 0-9, multiple messages for big hands?)
  House rules(?)

Roll stuff
  Make sure it works as intended -- keep an eye out for further things to do
  Improve by adding capability for 'explain'
  Add 'explode'
